+ text search and filters only are applied to the current list of tweets being shown and not to ALL of them

+ when TWITTER_UNUSUAL_LOGIN_TEXT is found, there's a bug. Make sure this case is handled properly.

+ cuando se borra UN saved tweet, queda el 'alert' desplegado en el tweetDetailsDialog y se ve cuando abris un nuevo tweet.

+ if my saved bookmarks on twitter are 5 and i already have them saved, they won't be added to savedX but if 
    the 'delete after scrape = true', they will be deleted after the session is over. 
    + Maybe i should have a way to exclusively delete one by one only if they were added to savedX.

+ after an individual saved tweet is deleted, there is this timer that will hide the dialog but if i delete, hide it and open a new
    tweetdetaildialog, then it will hide the new one.

+ improve 'stop the scrape' sometimes it takes too long

+ que durante savedX est√° scrapeando, vaya guardando los errores para luego desplegarlos todos juntos.
