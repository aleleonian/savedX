+ cuando se borra UN saved tweet, queda el 'alert' desplegado en el tweetDetailsDialog y se ve cuando abris un nuevo tweet.

+ if my saved bookmarks on twitter are 5 and i already have them saved, they won't be added to savedX but if 
    the 'delete after scrape = true', they will be deleted after the session is over. 
    + Maybe i should have a way to exclusively delete one by one only if they were added to savedX.

+ after an individual saved tweet is deleted, there is this timer that will hide the dialog but if i delete, hide it and open a new
    tweetdetaildialog, then it will hide the new one.

+ text search and filters only are applied to the current list of tweets being shown and not to ALL of them

+ Sometimes this happens: [2025-01-08 08:29:32.190] [debug] deleteTwitterBookmarks2() started
    + but it never ends!
